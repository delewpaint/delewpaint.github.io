	  <span class="title">Experience</span><br>
	  Delew Painting has successfully restored, waterproofed and 
      painted over 2000 homes and buildings in the past two decades. Our solid reputation 
      for quality and continuing success reflect our philosophy. We believe that 
      every job done well is the most effective advertising possible. We are a service 
      oriented company, and our long list of satisfied customers will prove this.	  
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  <span class="title">Competitive Pricing</span><br>
	  People are amazed that Delew Painting can offer such quality work at such
	  competitive prices. How do we do it? We do it by organizing each job for maximum
	  efficiency, by training each man to perform his tasks in the right order, and by
	  providing the best tools and products obtainable. By estimating the cost of each

	  money.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  <span class="title">Neatness and Efficiency</span><br>
	  In the painting business, neatness counts a lot. Our foremen carry a full complement
	  of tarps, plastic sheeting, taping machines and other material and devices that may be 
	  required. This insures that paint goes where it's supposed to go. Driveways, walkways,
	  patios, shrubbery, plants, windows, etc. are left neat and clean upon completion.
	  </p>
	  

	  <p>
	  <span class="title">Quality Products</span><br>
	  Thorough surface preparation and top quality paints help insure a lasting job. We only
	  use premimum Dunn Edwards, Kelly-Moore and Benjamin Moore top line finishes as well as
	  Elastomeric waterproof coatings. Our volume discounts allow us to provide these products
	  at an affordable price.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  <span class="title">Dependability</span><br>
	  For over twenty years, we have been serving The North Bay and beyond. Every job is
	  guaranteed in writing and, more importantly, we will be around to back it up. Our
	  guarantees are not loaded with disclaimers that render it worthless. All problems which
	  may arise are handled in a non-argumentative manner. Our reputation is our most important
	  asset!
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  <span class="title">Licensed, Bonded &amp; Insured</span><br>
	  We have all required insurances (workers compensation, contractors bond, general liability 
	  for $2 million). We have been with the same insurance companies for over 10 years.

	  <strong>June 23, 2009</strong>      
	  <p>Thank you for completing on time and on a budget the interior and exterior
	    painting of our new house in Napa. It is now the pride of the neighborhood,
	    aside from ours. You and your crew were fastidious in your attention
	    to detail and did a fantastic prep and paint job with the complicated multicolor
	    scheme of our designer.</p>
<p>Owing to the size of our house (over 4,000 square feet), we had many bids
  for this job but you convinced us you could do better than anyone else and
  you certainly delivered beyond our expectations. We have had many homes
  painted and repainted over the years but hiring you was the best decision
  we ever made. You can count on our keeping your number when we will have
  another job.</p>
	  <p>Feel free to use our name as a reference in the future.</p>
      <p>With sincere appreciation,<br>

	  <h4>What our customers say about us</h4>
	  <p>
	  <strong>September 25, 2009</strong>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  I highly recommend Delew Painting for an outstanding paint job on
	    the exterior of our Fountain Grove home during September 2008. The prep
	    job was outstanding. The whole project moved forward in a very smooth,
	    efficient manner. The Delew team went far beyond the call of duty to
	    deliver an excellent paint job. The detailed work was amazing.</p>
	  <p>
	  We have also had very good experiences with Delew Painting in the
	    past. Delew Painting painted the interior of our home about five
	    years ago, again with a beautiful outcome. Previous to that, Greg also painted
	    both the interior and exterior of our first home in Larkfield. On every
	    occasion, he has given his best efforts to fully satisfy our sometimes
	    particular and fussy needs, and has delivered beyond our expectations with
	    enthusiasm, conscientious work ethic, high-integrity, and high value.</p>
	  <p>
	  It has truly been a pleasure working with Delew Painting on all of
	    our painting experience. Greg and his team at Delew Painting have my
      highest recommendation for excellence in painting. </p>
	  <p>
	  Sincerely,
	    <br>
      Roger A. Klein, M.D., M.S. </p>
